# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates an AWS Strands based application that automatically processes PDF content to generate social media posts. The application will randomly select pages from a PDF document, analyze the content using LLM capabilities, extract key insights, and format them into concise social media posts suitable for platforms like X (Twitter).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the application to randomly select pages from a PDF document, so that I can generate diverse social media content from different sections of the book.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL randomly select a page number from the available pages in book.pdf
2. WHEN a random page is selected THEN the system SHALL read that page and the 2-3 pages immediately following it
3. IF the selected page is near the end of the document THEN the system SHALL read only the available remaining pages
4. WHEN pages are read THEN the system SHALL extract the text content from each page

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the application to understand the context of the selected pages using LLM, so that the generated posts are coherent and meaningful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text content is extracted from pages THEN the system SHALL send the content to an LLM for analysis
2. WHEN the LLM processes the content THEN the system SHALL identify the core themes and key messages
3. WHEN analyzing content THEN the system SHALL understand the overall context across the selected pages
4. IF the content spans multiple topics THEN the system SHALL identify the primary theme

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a social media manager, I want the application to generate concise X posts, so that I can share engaging content that fits platform constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the LLM understands the context THEN the system SHALL extract the core message from the analyzed content
2. WHEN generating the post THEN the system SHALL limit the output to 280 characters maximum
3. WHEN creating the post THEN the system SHALL ensure the message is engaging and coherent
4. WHEN the post is generated THEN the system SHALL preserve the essential meaning of the source content

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to be built using AWS Strands, so that it can leverage cloud-native capabilities and scalability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the application THEN the system SHALL use AWS Strands framework
2. WHEN processing PDF files THEN the system SHALL handle file operations efficiently
3. WHEN making LLM calls THEN the system SHALL integrate with appropriate AWS AI services
4. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work with the existing book.pdf file, so that I can immediately start generating content without additional setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL locate the book.pdf file in the root directory
2. WHEN accessing the PDF THEN the system SHALL verify the file exists and is readable
3. IF the PDF file is not found THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message
4. WHEN processing the PDF THEN the system SHALL handle various PDF formats and structures
