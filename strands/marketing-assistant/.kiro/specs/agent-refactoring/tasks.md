# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Create utilities module with shared functions
  - Extract common utility functions from agent.py into utils.py
  - Implement post cleaning and validation functions
  - Create response parsing utilities for AWS Bedrock
  - Add input validation helpers
  - Write unit tests for utility functions
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 2. Extract PDF processor functionality
  - Create pdf_processor.py module with the pdf_processor tool
  - Move PDF-related imports (PyPDF2, os, random) and dependencies
  - Extract pdf_processor function from agent.py with identical interface
  - Preserve all existing functionality including random page selection and error handling
  - Write unit tests for PDF processing with mocked file operations
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [ ] 3. Extract content analyzer functionality
  - Create content_analyzer.py module with content analysis tools
  - Move content_analyzer and _mock_content_analysis functions from agent.py
  - Move AWS Bedrock integration imports (boto3, json, strands_tools.use_aws)
  - Use utilities from utils.py for response parsing (parse_bedrock_response)
  - Preserve error handling and fallback mechanisms
  - Write unit tests with mocked AWS calls and file operations
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 4. Extract post generator functionality
  - Create post_generator.py module with post generation tools
  - Move post_generator and _mock_post_generation functions from agent.py
  - Move social media post creation and optimization logic
  - Use utilities from utils.py (clean_and_validate_post, optimize_post_length)
  - Remove _clean_and_validate_post and _optimize_post_length from agent.py (now in utils.py)
  - Preserve mock generation functionality and AWS integration
  - Write unit tests for post generation and optimization
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 5. Refactor main agent file to use modular imports
  - Update agent.py to import tools from pdf_processor, content_analyzer, and post_generator modules
  - Register all imported tools with the Agent using the same names
  - Preserve the letter_counter tool in the main agent.py file
  - Remove the extracted tool functions and their helper functions from agent.py
  - Remove redundant imports that are now in separate modules
  - Ensure all tools are accessible with identical interfaces
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [ ] 6. Create comprehensive test suite for extracted modules
  - Create test_pdf_processor.py with unit tests for PDF processing functionality
  - Create test_content_analyzer.py with mocked AWS tests and mock analysis tests
  - Create test_post_generator.py with post generation and optimization tests
  - Create test_integration.py to test cross-module communication and Agent functionality
  - Ensure all tests pass and cover edge cases and error conditions
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3_

- [ ] 7. Validate functionality and backward compatibility
  - Test all tools through the Agent to ensure identical behavior to original implementation
  - Verify error handling produces the same error messages and response formats
  - Test both AWS and mock modes for analysis and generation tools
  - Validate that no functionality was lost during refactoring
  - Run integration tests to confirm the Agent works exactly as before
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3_
