# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring the existing monolithic `agent.py` file into a modular structure with separate files for different functionalities. The current file contains multiple tools, utility functions, and data processing logic that should be organized into logical modules to improve maintainability, testability, and code organization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the PDF processing functionality separated into its own module, so that PDF-related operations are isolated and easier to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL have a separate `pdf_processor.py` module containing the `pdf_processor` tool and related functionality
2. WHEN the PDF module is imported THEN it SHALL provide the same interface as the original `pdf_processor` tool
3. WHEN PDF processing is invoked THEN it SHALL maintain all existing functionality including error handling and return format

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the content analysis functionality separated into its own module, so that AI-powered analysis operations are organized and reusable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL have a separate `content_analyzer.py` module containing the `content_analyzer` tool and mock analysis functions
2. WHEN the content analyzer is used THEN it SHALL preserve all AWS Bedrock integration and mock functionality
3. WHEN analysis fails THEN it SHALL maintain the same error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the social media post generation functionality in its own module, so that post creation logic is isolated and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL have a separate `post_generator.py` module containing the `post_generator` tool and related utilities
2. WHEN post generation is invoked THEN it SHALL maintain all character limit validation and optimization features
3. WHEN the post generator uses mock mode THEN it SHALL preserve the same mock generation behavior

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want utility functions organized into a separate utilities module, so that common helper functions are reusable across modules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL have a `utils.py` module containing shared utility functions
2. WHEN utility functions are called THEN they SHALL maintain the same behavior as in the original implementation
3. WHEN modules import utilities THEN they SHALL have access to all necessary helper functions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the main agent file to serve as an orchestrator, so that the overall structure remains clean and imports are centralized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the `agent.py` file SHALL import and register all tools from separate modules
2. WHEN the agent is instantiated THEN it SHALL have access to all original tools with the same interface
3. WHEN tools are invoked THEN they SHALL function identically to the original monolithic implementation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing functionality preserved, so that no features are lost during the refactoring process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all original tools SHALL be available with identical interfaces
2. WHEN any tool is executed THEN it SHALL produce the same results as the original implementation
3. WHEN error conditions occur THEN they SHALL be handled with the same error messages and recovery mechanisms
